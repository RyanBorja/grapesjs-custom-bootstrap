Font awesome 4 is inluded in Grapes Js and they are trying to update to Font Awesome 5 / to just put in svg's instead of linking using the FA4 classes.

There is a very bad conflict when I included Font Awesome 5. Everything breaks.

Solution for the time being is:
1) Use Font Awesome 4 icon classes where I can
2) Use Bootstrap 3.3.7 included glyphIcons
3) Use the svg's from the Font awesome 5 files and put that in where needed
